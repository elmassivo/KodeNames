# KodeNames
A clone of the board game Codenames (this one is called CODENAMES AND DRAGONS)

# Description
Codenames and Dragons has been designed explcitly for my group's DnD campaign on 'off' evenings.
'Kodenames' has been reformatted to work better on mobile, and has had its CSS updated to allow for a more intuitive/smooth experience.

# Instructions:
1. Set a seed or just copy your URL to other players (hash will automatch)
2. Spymasters click the hamburger menu > spymaster button to see key. 
3. Find the right spies, don't get assassinated, try to leave a few bystanders alive.

# TODO
1. Get more/better words
2. Allow board size increase
3. Optimize better for mobile (works, just not fantastically)
4. More themes?
